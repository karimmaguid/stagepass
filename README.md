Welcome to Stagepass, 2nd place app at [Outside Hacks] (https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/outside-hacks-ii)

Demo Video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0GHztH9qxs] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0GHztH9qxs)

Stagepass was designed and built in 24 hours at Outside Lands' hackathon to connect fans, artists, and sponsors like never before.

How it works

1. Fans submit photos to their favorites artists
2. Artists choose from their top fans and give away sponsored prizes.
3. Sponsors get their brands promoted by participating artists.

It's a WIN-WIN all around.
