Stagepass was designed and built in 24 hours at Outside Lands' hackathon to connect fans, artists, and sponsors like never before.

How it works

1. Fans submit photos to their favorites artists
2. Artists choose from their top fans and give away sponsored prizes.
3. Sponsors get their brands promoted by participating artists.

It's a WIN-WIN all around.

How it's built:

App: 

	* AngularJS - MVC running the whole show
	* Ionic Framework - Mobile UI framework 
	* JQuery - Used for image resizing in app instead of server side to eliminate having to send giant image files over cell data in a crowded festival.

Backend: 

	* [Parse] (http://www.parse.com) - NodeJS and MongoDB
	* PHP - Used for image upload to a file server.
